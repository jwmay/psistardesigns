						<p>Welcome to the online home of web developer Joseph W. May.  By day, I teach high school chemistry in North Las Vegas; by night, I'm still working on my day-job.  However, on weekends, breaks, and summer I enjoy web development.  I have experience in HTML/CSS, jQuery, PHP, WordPress theme and plugin development, responsive design, and Bootstrap.  I primarily work with academic research groups, which is where my joy for web design and development began.  I completed my Ph.D. in computational chemistry at the University of Washington, Seattle.  During my time there, I learned to program and found satisfaction in the design element that comes with programming for the web.  I also realized my real passion was in education, which is what led me to become a teacher.</p>
						
						<p>Due to my nine-month-long day-job as a teacher, I have limited time between August and June for development projects.  However, if you are interested in my services, please contact me at <a href="mailto:psistardesigns@gmail.com">psistardesigns@gmail.com</a>.  For samples of my work, check out my portfolio below.</p>
